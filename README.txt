DrawingKit is a collection of commands for use in Sketch, a vector graphics application for the MacOS by Bohemian Coding (www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch).

Nearly all scripts in this collection include a ‘User Variables’ section, where the default settings may be changed to suit your own preferences. (No coding skill needed!) In addition, many commands include options that are accessible by holding a modifier key (e.g., Option) when the command is run within Sketch. These options and their modifier keys are typically indicated in Sketch's mini-toolbar when the command is run.

TIP: To download these scripts, click the ‘ZIP’ button above, which will ‘download the repository’ as a ZIP file. Once you've unzipped the contents, you can toss the README file and place the scripts directly in Sketch's Plugins folder (within the user library Application Support folder, you can get access to that folder by opening the Plugins menu, choosing "Custom Script..." and then clicking in the gear icon and choosing "Open Plugins Folder"). You're free to organize these scripts in any way you like; I recommend creating a subfolder within Plugins called “DrawingKit” to keep them organized as a set. The collection includes an optional set of developer's scripts (within a subfolder) and a graphic that serves to keep this set separated from the main commands within the interface menu.
